# Some question

I have some question about test

When a customer buys a double set of Orange, a double set of Pink, and a single Blue set:

Question 1:

What should the price be?

Calculation 1:
((120+120)-5%) + ((80+80)-5%) + 30 = 228+152+30 = 410

Calculation 2:
(120+120+80+80+30)-5% = 408.5

Based on my understanding, the correct price should be Calculation 2.

Question 2:

If the customer has a member card with a 5% discount, should the additional 10% discount be applied afterward, or should a 15% discount be applied directly?
(Assuming the answer to Question 1 is Calculation 2):

Calculation 1:
(120+120+80+80+30) = 430 - 5% = 387 - 10% = 367.65
Calculation 2:
(120+120+80+80+30) = 430 - 15% = 365.5

I believe the correct price should be Calculation 1

This test base on Question 1 answer Calculation 2 and Question 2 answer Calculation 1
